class DictStruct(dict):
    '''
    Slightly elaborate implementation given the purpose today for just this and the following 2 classes. But maybe it
    will develop into something more useful. The key thing here is that at times out dict based structures turn back
    into dict's. For example when loading from file. This class allows them to be retured with the simple

    struct = DictStruct.from_dict(dictionary)

    you can also if you know what it is say

    known_struct = KnownStruct.from_dict(dictionary)

    Maybe we can even add some post hook to json.loads (to make this happen automagically). I've chosen __dict_struct_type__
    so that we don't get a name clash with something.

    At present I'm not putting this in iml_common, because I'm not convinced it is good enough yet as an idea, but
    maybe moving forwards with a little more work and generalization we can do that.
