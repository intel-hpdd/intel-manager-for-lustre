'''
This allows code to be placed in safe space for production (?) where uncaught exceptions are captured and logged
but passed not further. This means we can have a resilient application for production but see all the badness in
test / development. Use carefully to sandbox functionality.

It is implemented as a context handler and a decorator so that the user can use the most appropriate implementation
for there needs.
