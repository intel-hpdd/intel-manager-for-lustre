def safe_eval(expression, properties):
    '''
    safe_eval is an safe expression evaluator. It is fairly well featured and allows for all the operators
    defined abot in binops to be used, it can handle bracketing and understand operator precedence.

    The code takes an expression and a list of properties that will be substituted into the expression.

    For example the expression may be "zfs_installed == False" and the properties might be {"zfs_installed": True}

    Before evaluation this "zfs_installed == False" would be transformed to "1 == 0" - Note that as well as transforming
    the variables True/False and transformed to 1/0.

    The evaluator can return true/false (1/0) or arithmetic answers, it can also deal with string comparisons.

    :param expression: The expression to evaluate.
    :param properties: The properties to be used for the evaluation
    :return: The result of the evaluation or an exception.
