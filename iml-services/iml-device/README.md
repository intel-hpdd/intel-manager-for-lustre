# IML Device

This crate consumes changes from device agent daemon plugins and persists them to the database.

It uses SQLx for data persistence.

A local db is required only when making changes to the SQLx queries in this crate.
In order to interact with a running database add a `.env` file in this directory with a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
For example, to connect to a local chroma db running on localhost the `.env` file would look like:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://chroma@localhost:5432/chroma
```

Once a change has been made to a query, run the following in this directory:

```sh
cargo sqlx prepare -- --tests
```

You can check if the generated queries are up to date with:

```sh
cargo sqlx prepare --check -- --tests
```

You may need to install the sqlx-cli as well:

```sh
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres --git https://github.com/jgrund/sqlx --branch workspace-prepare
```
