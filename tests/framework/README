This directory tree contains the framework code that is used to run our tests.
This should not include any test code itself, but only the code to setup the
test environment and initiate the running of the tests. This is where you
will find the environmentally specific code, such as Jenkins steps,
provisioner interface, etc. Some of these may be modified to be used in
different environments, but by default are written to work in our team CI.
