Storage Server Plugin Framework
-------------------------------
Your storage server plugin should be in a .py file in a subdirectory of this
project.  The example provided is in
example_storage_plugin/example_storage_plugin.py but you may name your
directory and .py anything you wish.

You must create a __init__.py file in your subdirectory which imports all of
resource classes created in your .py file.

You must then edit the setup.py file in this directory and change the name,
version, author, author_email, url, license, description, and long_description
fields.

You must set the name of your plugin in update_settings on the first line.

Once all of the above is done, your plugin package can then be built with:

$ python setup.py bdist_rpm

and your resulting RPM will be in the dist/ subdir.
